# type_train
Keyboard typing training with python/ncurses.
The script generates a random sentence with 50 words using the Python nltk package.
Your job is to type the sentence following the cursor (you can also use backspace). The script displays your accuracy and speed (measured in correct characters per minute).
You can exit at any time by pressing ESC.

The script needs the python nltk package, which can be install with:
```sh
pip install nltk
```
Or with the relevant OS command in case the package is managed by the OS.
